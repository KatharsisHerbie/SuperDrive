# SuperDrive
A live-processing capable, clean(-ish) implementation of lane & path detection based on comma.ai's SuperCombo neural network model

Tested with Python 3.8 on Ubuntu 20.04

### Running
To get a list of all the options, run `python3 drive.py -h`
To run the code with visualizations, run `python3 drive.py --input <input> --show-opencv-window`

### Note
I don't really know what I'm doing here, so this code *will probably* contain bugs (as of this first push, it still doesn't really work and is awfully slow), please don't refer to it until everything has been squared out!
