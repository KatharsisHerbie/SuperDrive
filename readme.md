# SuperDrive
A live-processing capable, clean(-ish) implementation of lane & path detection based on comma.ai's SuperCombo neural network model

### Running
A simple call of `python3 drive.py` will do. This loads `test.m4v` (which is also distributed along with the code), a short driving clip on a curved highway, which can be used to test the code out :)

### Note
I don't really know what I'm doing here, so this code *will probably* contain bugs (as of this first push, it still doesn't really work and is awfully slow), please don't refer to it until everything has been squared out!
